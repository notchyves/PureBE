PureBE is an edited version of Minecraft for **Windows 10/11** and **Android** devices **ONLY!** This edited version removes unneeded features that cause the game to be less enjoyable. It also strives to improve your FPS, without removing features and even adding features to enhance gameplay.

# Common Questions
## üõ†Ô∏è Will PureBE be compatible with other clients such as Toolbox and Onix?
PureBE is just an edited Minecraft build but will not change any essential files to make other programs not recognize the program. However, we make no guarentees nor do we handle compatibility with other programs. If one of our updates breaks this compatibility we are not responsible, nor it is our primary goal to keep support for these things.

## üéÆ Why can't I run PureBE on my iOS/Console device?
Sadly, PureBE does not work on any other devices other than Android and Windows 10/11. The reason behind this is, there are not ways to install modified apps on other devices without breaking a warranty, or doing some bizzare method that we don't want our users attempting. For this reason, we have decided not to port PureBE over to those devices. Do not try other things that claim to support PureBE on unsupported devices as they are most likely scams.

## ü§î Is PureBE a client?
PureBE is not a client, it is a build of Minecraft that has been edited to remove unwanted things and add things that enhance gameplay. We do not consider ourselves any sort of client nor do not claim to support any client. We do not have any intention in building a client in the future.
